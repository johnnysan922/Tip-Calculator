To use the tipcalculator app, you must run the application through
a phone emulator using android studio code or anyother program. Once 
you are in the app, you input the value for the check cost and another 
value for the amount of people paying for the check. After you have inputted
the values, you click the 'compute tip' button. You will see how much 
the amount of money a 15%, 20%, and 25% tip, respectively, and the total
cost with a 15%, 20% and 25% tip.
